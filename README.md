MALT iOS application

The Mortgage Assistance and Learning Tool (MALT) is an iOS application aimed at first-time house buyers to inform them about mortgages. It assumes no prior knowledge of mortgages or a user's level of mathematical ability in order to cater for the general public. However, there are also sections in the app that to allow users with a higher mathematical ability to explore how the simple repayment formulae has been derived. This not only keeps the more advanced user engaged, but also allows them to appreciate how the time value of money affects a mortgage holder. All users will be able to use the methods that we teach them to help them to independently assess mortgages offered in the market to find the most suitable deal for themselves.

This project received 98% in the University of Leeds final Mathematics project and the app was a collaboration between myself and Chris Bodger.

There is an accompanying report to this project to fully explain the work. Should you wish to know more, please email harry@tongy.io and I will send you a copy.
